# Battle_Tank
Open world head to head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and UE4 control systems

## Concept:
Battle Tank is a 3D tank simulator that pits the player versus another player or a computer controlled AI. The players engage across an open, simulated terrain featuring hills, valleys, and possibly vegetation, rivers, or wetlands. The landscape might also feature land mines or mortars to add to the challenge.

### Player experience:
Skilled tank commander in combat

### Viewpoint:
3rd person

## Rules:
* Movement is limited by the tankâ€™s maximum speed
* Ammunition is limited (say 50 rounds?) with no reloads
* Each tank can only take a limited number of hits (5?)
* Because this is tank vs tank combat, each tank has only its main gun, no need to enable the small machine gun
* The first tank to destroy its enemy wins. If both tanks run out of ammo with neither destroyed, the match is a draw.

### Possible additional things to incorporate:
* Tanks slow down as they take damage, or steering becomes inconsistent or erratic
* Random power-ups that allow either tank to renew its ammo

## Needed:
Good tank pictures to build mesh
### Sounds:
* diesel engine noise (background)
* track noises (when moving)
* gun noises (when shooting)
* reload noises (possible? - before or after shooting)
* explosion noises (hits on enemy)
* crash or explosion noises (hits on player)
